# Javascript-Dinosaur-Game

This is the first game I've ever made in Javascript, and I made it in approximately 20 minutes following a tutorial by KnifeCircus: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bG2BmmYr9NQ&ab_channel=KnifeCircus

You can modify the code and do whatever you want with the project, I won't really care :)
Thanks for playing!
